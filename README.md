# React Bootstrap Icons

> Currently v1.7.1, over **1500 icons!**

120 new icons
This update was a lot of fun for meâ€”drawing all these tiny computer parts most of all! There are dozens of new computer-related icons for parts, ports, and peripheral devices. There are also several new brand icons, including Meta, and some other fun icons like a new robot head and a boombox.
